# Unity-Ignore-And-Attributes
 
Add BOTH of these files to the root level of your github repo (ie, inside the main repo folder, NOT inside the Unity project folder). You may likely already have a .gitattributes file so if it asks to replace one (or both) files, say yes.

# Steps

1. Copy both the .gitignore and .gitattributes files in this repo
2. Navigate to your project repo root folder (the base/beginning github repo folder on your computer)
3. Paste both files there
4. Commit and push

If you encounter any issues, take a screenshot of the error and email me.
